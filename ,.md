# There are many species of wild animals in the world, but their habitat is under threat due to the expansion of cities and the destruction of natural places. Deforestation for construction, environmental pollution and the use of toxic chemicals negatively affect the lives of animals such as frogs and fish, leading to their extinction. To help protect wildlife, you can explore local ecosystems, contact municipal authorities and environmental organizations, as well as clean up garbage yourself and create small habitats for animals in your gardens or on balconies.

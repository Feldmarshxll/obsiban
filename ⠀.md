# Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a growing global issue. It includes old phones, computers, and other electronic devices that are no longer in use. The problem lies in the toxic substances they contain, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can contaminate soil, water, and air if not properly disposed of. Moreover, e-waste holds valuable materials like gold, copper, and rare earth metals that are wasted when devices are not recycled. To address this, we can choose longer-lasting electronics, repair devices instead of discarding them, and dispose of old electronics at specialized recycling centers. The best solution, in my opinion, is to enforce stricter regulations requiring manufacturers to take responsibility for recycling their products. Additionally, advancing recycling technologies and raising public awareness about the importance of e-waste management are crucial steps forward.
